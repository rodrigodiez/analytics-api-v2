TS Koa API styleguide
===

The following project contains a boilerplate for a Typescript/NodeJS/Koa API with the aim of documenting some recommended patterns for structuring, developing and testing similar projects in the future.

The main goal of these recommendations are to create APIs that are highly predictable, fun to work with and testable so that developers spend most of the time adding new features and can deploy with confidence

> _"All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed"_

> _"Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it"_

> _"Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If other people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec."_
